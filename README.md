# OS Concepts Assignments in Rust

My attempts to rewrite my Operating Systems course assignments (written in C) in Rust

## Why?

I've tried countless of times to get into Rust because of all the hype surrounding it, but always found it too hard :P  
I also had no projects that called for its use and always opted for JavaScript/TypeScript because of its familiarity and it was always good enough. This made me less motivated to learn Rust and never touched it again for a long time.
Then comes my Operating Systems course, which required C/C++ for assignments. It was almost impossible at first with a lot of C and systems programming pitfalls but I eventually got the hang of it by the third assignment. These are the kinds of things that Rust is supposed to fix, so it was the perfect applications for learning Rust.
